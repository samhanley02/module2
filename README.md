# INET4031 - Module 2 - The System Administrator's Toolbox

## System Administration in Context

Let's continue to do some more stuff like we did in Module 1 and continue our introductory exploration of system administration.

Click on the "Wiki" link above to view directions for this Lab.

The code in this repository is NOT used by this lab. Code from Lab 1 is reused.

The code in this repo are example code for those who may want to explore the Node-Red and Jupyter systems more.  Reach out to the instructor if interested.

**CONTEXT MATTERS**

System Administration is not "one size fits all."  It is not even "one size fits most."

A System Administrator who is responsible for managing a company's Active Directory Windows Servers is going to use vastly different tools than an Administrator on a DevOps team that is responsible for a Web Application.  These are vastly different contexts.

In upcoming Modules we will begin work on the administration of Servers. Right now though we are going to concetrate on the "system administration" you already know how to do.  You've no doubt had to install software on your laptop. Installing programs, installing programming languages, making configuration changes to connect your laptop to a WiFi network.  Although we may not think of this as "system administration" it IS system administration - adminstration of your local system.

Let's also approach the activities in this module using some CONTEXT. 

For instance:

* A Code Development team that uses GitHub as a source code repository.
* A Data Science team that uses Jupypter Notebooks and Python.
* An team responsible for an Internet of Things (IoT) Application 

In this module we are going to do the following:

* The student will create their own GitHub repository using their GitHub account created in Module 1
* Install the Jupyter Notebook system like many Data Scientist use.
* Install the NodeJS package so that we can run JavaScript programs on our computers.
* Install a Low-Code Programming Environment called Node-Red that is often used to develop event-driven applications like IoT
